<h1><a name="story1" id="story1"></a>FACTS ABOUT THE COMPANY&rsquo;S SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROGRAM</h1>
<br /><br />
<p><img class="rtImg" src="images/newsletter/cartoon0409.gif" alt="Cartoon" width="400" height="424" />Contrary to the comic shown, the company does have independent administrators that make the random selections using a computer software program.  We actually have   three separate administrators: St. Louis MRO for the DOT program, the Carpenters&rsquo; District Council of Greater St. Louis and Vicinity for our carpenter craft workers and Construction Data Services (CDS) for our AGC operators, laborers and finishers.</p>
<p>Each administrative program is currently set up to test at a 50% annualized rate for substance abuse and 10% for alcohol.  For example, we currently have approximately 100 employees enrolled in the AGC&rsquo;s operator/laborer/finisher program.  Throughout the calendar year, approximately 50 employees would be randomly selected for a substance test and approximately 10 for alcohol based on the 50% and 10% rate.</p>
<p>The Department of Transportation (DOT) tests for the five substances they believe are most commonly abused.  Called the &quot;DOT 5 panel&quot; they are: marijuana; cocaine; amphetamines/methamphetamine; opiates (codeine, morphine and heroin); and phencyclidine (PCP).   The AGC operators/laborers/finishers program adds four to the DOT 5: barbiturates; benzodiazepines; methadone and propoxyphene; and the Carpenter&rsquo;s program adds one more:  methaqualone for an even 10 panel.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether we are working, every month these programs send us a random selection list. That is why each spring we have a group of employees that need to re-enroll because they were selected during the winter lay off season.</p>

<p><strong>None of the programs just test for drug use</strong>,   but all of the programs do test for drug abuse.  Thus, the name, substance abuse testing.  There are few, if any, of us that have never taken prescription medication.  Maybe there was some less-than-legal second had smoke at the party last weekend?  Each program takes these situations into consideration.  There is what they call &quot;cut-off&quot; levels for each substance tested that allows for a certain quantity of those substances to be in our system.  When the test results exceed the cut-off level for a substance, then you get an opportunity to talk to the Medical Review Officer (MRO) and provide an explanation.  If you are taking prescription medication, then the MRO confirms it with your pharmacist or doctor and all is good.  Be aware, though, the prescription must be in <strong>your nam</strong>e, not your family members or neighbor&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>We have more than a handful of employees that are lucky enough to be subject to two random substance abuse testing programs each month as a result of wearing several hats for the company.  For example, we have laborers and operators that are subject to their program, but because they may operate a regulated commercial motor vehicle occasionally, they are also subject to the DOT&rsquo;s program too.</p>
<p>Statistics for the calendar year 2008 for the AGC operator/laborer/finisher random substance abuse testing program revealed that out of all the employees randomly selected, only two were selected twice.  For the DOT&rsquo;s program, three employees were selected more than once, with one of the two being selected three times. No one in the carpenter&rsquo;s program was selected more than once during the year.</p>
<p>Of those employees in two random substance abuse testing programs, none were selected for both programs during the year.</p>

<h1><a name="story2" id="story2"></a>NATIONAL WORK ZONE 
AWARENESS WEEK 2009</h1><br /><br />
<p><strong>&quot;Drive to Survive&mdash;Our Future is Riding On It&quot;</strong></p>
<div class="leftImg"><img src="images/newsletter/awareness_week.jpg" width="158" height="158" alt="National Work Zone Awareness Week 2009" /></div><p>April 6-10 marks the 10th anniversary of National Work Zone Awareness Week.&nbsp; The national campaign is conducted every year at the start of the construction season to attract national attention to drive carefully through highway construction and repair sites. Each year, approximately 1,000 people are killed in roadway work zones, and, with the recent enactment of the President&rsquo;s economic recovery package which supports a good deal of highway repair and construction funding, 2009 could be one of the most active highway repair seasons in recent memory.</p>
<p>In Missouri, MoDOT is sponsoring Operation Orange to increase work zone awareness and honor fallen workers by lighting state landmarks orange during the week.  West Contracting&rsquo;s Sullivan office participates with a banner across the building that says SLOW DOWN IN WORK ZONES...IT&rsquo;S THE LAW! and by placing orange barrels in front.  See pictures below of various Operation Orange participants.</p>

<h1><a name="story4" id="story4"></a>LARRY RANSOM</h1>
<div class="leftImg"><img src="images/newsletter/lransom1.jpg" alt="Larry Ransom" width="206" height="164" /></div>

<p>I am the equipment mover.  I have been moving equipment into and out of our jobsites for the past seven years.  Prior to that I worked for WCEC, the company&rsquo;s jobsite material supply division for three years, which followed six years of being an equipment operator, mostly D-9&rsquo;s, for J. H. Berra Construction Co.</p>
<p>My prior experience as an equipment operator and truck driver blended perfectly with my current position.  Since I am constantly loading and unloading various construction equipment, having the background of operating equipment really helped.  My truck driving experience allowed me to be familiar with safety rules and regulations for commercial motor vehicles (CMV).</p>
<div class="capt2"><img src="images/newsletter/lransom2.jpg" alt="Larry Ransom" width="261" height="193" /><br /><span class="captTxt">Larry, using a little elbow grease to bind down   
  a  piece of equipment.</span></div>
<p>
  In addition to CMV safety rules, there are plenty of other safety concerns/responsibilities involved with being an equipment mover.  For one, my truck and trailer are approximately 53 feet long, and some of the jobsites require some very creative maneuvering to get into and back out.   Having a spotter is important when backing up.  Sometimes you just have to get out and inspect the area before backing.  Loading and unloading equipment from the trailer, especially when some of the tires overhang the edge of the trailer is very challenging.  I am constantly checking the chains and binders used to hold the equipment in place on the trailer for damage and wear.</p>
<p>Running unloaded is the worst because the trailer wants to jump over to the adjoining lane every time I brake.  You just have to use common sense.</p>

<h1><a name="story6" id="story6"></a>LAST MONTH&rsquo;S QUESTIONS</h1>
<p> Just a follow-up note on the questions.</p>
<p>Many of you noted that there seemed to be two right answers for question #2 below.  Mandatory protection from cave-in&rsquo;s is required for excavations that are (c) five feet or deeper as noted in last month&rsquo;s newsletter article. Certainly, (b) a depth of six feet would require protection, but the cave-in  protection should be put in place at the 5 foot depth.</p>
<ol>
<li class="numbers">Which of the following are safety concerns for the man in the trench?
<ol>
  <li>No protection system in place to guard against cave-ins</li>
  <li>A ladder or other method to get out of trench is needed</li>
  <li>Needs protection from possible falling objects i.e. hardhat</li>
  <li class="txtBld">all of the above</li><br />
</ol></li>
<li class="numbers">What depth of excavation requires mandatory protection from cave-ins?
  <ol>
    <li>three feet</li>
    <li>six feet</li>
